## TP00RU03CP0001 Test the user check expression if 2D points are inside 2D polygons but one polygon dont have any internal point.

[First, check the open issues of this test](https://redmine.gvsig.net/redmine/projects/gvsig-desktop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&set_filter=1&f%5B%5D=status_id&op%5Bstatus_id%5D=o&f%5B%5D=subject&op%5Bsubject%5D=%7E&v%5Bsubject%5D%5B%5D=TP00RU03CP0001&f%5B%5D=&c%5B%5D=tracker&c%5B%5D=status&c%5B%5D=priority&c%5B%5D=subject&c%5B%5D=assigned_to&c%5B%5D=updated_on&group_by=)

### Description

This test case checks the UDR when we use incorrect 2D point datasets and correct 2D polygon dataset. The case has errors in the final result because the polygon dataset has one polygon with no internal points. The check expression seeks at least one internal point in each polygon but one polygon dont have ani internal point and does false it.

### Requirements

1. Have *gvSIG desktop 2.5.1* and *Topology framework plugin* installed.
2. Have acces to [**TP00RU03CP0001_pol2D_C.csv**](https://github.com/jolicar/TopologyRuleUserDefinedRule/blob/master/testing/cases/TP00_TopologyRules/RU03_UserDefinedRule/CP0001_UDR_I/TP00RU03CP0001_pol2D_C.csv) and [**TP00RU03CP0001_pts2D_I.csv**](https://github.com/jolicar/TopologyRuleUserDefinedRule/blob/master/testing/cases/TP00_TopologyRules/RU03_UserDefinedRule/CP0001_UDR_I/TP00RU03CP0001_pts2D_I.csv).

### Steps...

1. Load the layer **TP00RU03CP0001_pol2D_C.csv** in the view.
2. Load the layer **TP00RU03CP0001_pts2D_I.csv** in the view.
3. Create a new empty topology plan.
4. Fill the basic topology plan data.
5. Add the **TP00RU03CP0001_pol2D_C.csv** file like a dataset.
6. Add a new rules parameters on Rules tab.
7. On those rule parameters identify the *primary dataset*, the *User defined topology rule*. 
8. If *User defined topology rule* is selected, the UDR Parameters tab will be enabled.
9. Add the user check expression with expression builder; EXISTS( SELECT * FROM TP00RU03CP0000_pts2D_C WHERE ST_INTERSECTS(ST_FORCE2D(TP00RU03CP0000_pts2D_C.GEOMETRY), ST_FORCE2D(GEOMETRY())) LIMIT 1).
10. Click on the "Ok" button.
11. Click on the "Ok" button to finish the topology plan creation.
12. Execute the topology plan.


### Expected result

The expected results are the *Inspector de errores del Plan de topologia* window has one records. The polygon with ID equals to 2 does false the rule. Polygon ID=2 dont have any internal 2D point.


### Bug report


In case the obtained results are not correct, you can report an issue on *redmine* of *gvSIG deskop*. You can locate at
